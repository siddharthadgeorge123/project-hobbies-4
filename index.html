        <p>When I was about 4, I really wanted to learn how to play the piano. I just liked what you could do with the instrument. I had been playing an instrument at school for years so I knew the basics of music.
            <br /><br />I found a local music teacher to teach me the basics.
            I play a wide variety of music. When i first started I was pushed to play classical, which I still play and enjoy, but I've expanded into pop, new-age, and a little jazz.
            <br /><br />
            My most recent piece of music is a piano sonata by Mozart. I play other composers such Yann Tiersen, Eric Satie, and even Christina Perri.
            <br /><br />
            Every period has piano pieces to play, even up to very modern music. There are still dedicated piano composers who write piano music for a living. The music you hear on the radio isn't all that is out there.
            <br /><br />
            The Future
            I don't plan to play piano for a living. I am definitely not good enough. To become a professional pianist you have to have at least a bachelors degree in your instrument and then you must attend a conservatory to play the instrument for many years. Even then your chances of being hired as a pianist are slim.
            <br /><br />
            I only play as a hobby. It's something to do in my spare time.
